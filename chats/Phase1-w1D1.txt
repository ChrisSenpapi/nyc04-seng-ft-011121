15:21:37	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : What are objects in Ruby? What is "behavior" and "data"?
How do I write a class in Ruby?
What is a class and instance?
How do I create a new instance of the class?
How can I hack Ruby classes (e.g. String)? Why would I?
15:28:34	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : clear
15:28:45	 From Jahaira Marrero : Click on the trash bin?

15:33:27	 From Jeff Platt : ^^
15:34:30	 From Zak Dagnall : error
15:34:31	 From Matthew Thomas : error
15:34:33	 From Chris Read : Its undefined
15:35:59	 From Eric Kim : respond_to? is a nice method to know, but not a big priority at the moment
15:36:43	 From Zak Dagnall : yes
15:40:17	 From Eric Kim : Important information: `Puts` returns `nil`, which is different from the return value of a method
15:40:55	 From William Bugenis : names.join(“,”)
15:42:02	 From Dayne Dewar : names.join(‘, ‘)
15:42:27	 From Eric Kim : Social distancing rules
15:42:36	 From Sam Ferebee : ^^
15:45:06	 From Eric Kim : Regex (regular expressions) is one of those things that are nice to know, but you don’t need to become experts at it by the end of today’s lecture
15:46:04	 From Eric Kim : (I always google Regex in Ruby)
15:49:29	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : The way I learned some regex was just talking to myself a lot out loud while doing it so I remember some parts
15:49:38	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : but definitely, always using the cheat sheet
15:49:40	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : because
15:49:53	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : Regex is confusing
15:55:25	 From Jay Liu : Typo on name in dog2
15:56:18	 From andrewperlis : Name key on dog 2 is wrong
15:58:18	 From Eric Kim : Placeholder (the thing between the pipes) should always be the singular version of an element in the array
15:58:33	 From Eric Kim : Since it’s an array of dogs, a proper placeholder would be dog
16:01:53	 From Zak Dagnall : praise the Lord
16:08:14	 From Chris Read : How come it comes back nil again ?
16:08:30	 From Zak Dagnall : puts prints to the screen but doesnt *return* anything
16:08:46	 From Chris Read : Ohh I forgot about the top puts
16:11:50	 From Matthew Thomas : No return
16:11:52	 From Matthew Thomas : Its implicit
16:12:01	 From Jahaira Marrero : no
16:12:07	 From Jingchao Yu : Optional. But won’t break code
16:12:55	 From Eric Kim : Ruby implicitly returns the last block/line of code (!!!! Important idea !!!!)
16:14:35	 From Sam Ferebee : sora.bark
16:15:29	 From Sam Ferebee : What’s the shortcut to comment out on vs code?
16:15:51	 From Eric Kim : Highlight the line and press cmd + /
16:17:50	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : you don’t even have to highlight the line, just place your cursor there
16:18:04	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : THANK YOU FOR ASKING ABOUT THE SHORTCUTS
16:18:10	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : SHORTCUTS MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER
16:18:13	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : LEARN THEM
16:18:16	 From Eric Kim : option + Up/down arrow keys
16:18:25	 From Eric Kim : move the line of code in VSC up and down
16:18:26	 From Sylwia Vargas (she/her) : ^^^^^^^^^^!!!!!
16:23:24	 From Eric Kim : I’ve also heard of it being called duck-punching
16:24:18	 From Jay Liu : Haha, good one 
16:24:27	 From Eric Kim : Just because you could doesn’t mean you should
16:25:45	 From Eric Kim : self is going to be a very important keyword - we’ll cover it in greater detail in future lectures!
